## Activities to accomplish objectives:

 1. Split PLD in two sections: first with doubly linked lists and then with python structures.
 2. Discuss each objective in order with the exercises with did on the project.
 3. Whiteboard possible use cases for some methods.
 4. View examples online of lambda functions.
 5. Test code in online compiler



## Bottlenecks
Lambda functions.
Manipulating elements in doubly linked lists.

## Conclusions

Lambda functions can be very useful to compress code once they are understood but they can be hard to understand for a third-party viewer that needs to read your code.

Doubly linked lists are very useful when you need to store information and look for it regularly.
