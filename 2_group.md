# PLD

This is the summary of our PLD session

## Objectives

1. Lists vs Tuples vs Dictionary vs Sets
2. What is a Lambda function
3. How to use list and dictionary comprehension
4. Whats is map-reduce and map function
5. How to use a doubly-linked list

## Activities to accomplish Objectives

The first thing that we did was to do is discuss the different issues that we had with the project and the topics that were harder for each one, after that we did whiteboard and we check the documentation off the project, we also did examples of each topic.

## Bottleneck

Our principal bottleneck was understanding the concept of Lamba and how it works, we did multiple examples to fully understand this function.

## Conclusions

As python is a high-level language, is possible to make the same thing in different ways. It is important to know the advantages of each data structure to optimize the process and search the correct and more efficient way to apply algorithms.
