These are the objectives of group three, for study in the PLD.:

- 1. Concet set and some examples  **Votes = |**
>key, values, loops
- 2. Dictionary  and examples **Votes = |||** 
 >key, values, loops.
 - 3. Set vs List **Votes = ||**
 - 4. Lambda **Votes = |||||**
 > Funtions
 - 5. Map and Reduce **Votes = ||||**

### Activities

In order to learn the topics, the methodology that is used, mainly, was to validate the concepts of each of the topics and, from this, generate some exercises, which allowed us to understand each of the concepts, here are some examples:

- Set:
>S = {1, "Hello"}
> Not sorted
> Any Data Type

- Dictionary:
> D = {Key, Value}
> Only Strings and Integers
> Not sorted
> Any Data Type
- Print(D[key]) [Number of the position] --> To print a specific dictionary position

- List:
> L = [a,b,c]
> Sorted
> Any Data Type  but it is not recommended
> Print(l[tuple position])
- Tuples:
> t = (1, 2, 3)
> Sorted
> Any Data Type
> print(t[0])
- Loop in Dictionary:
> for i in D:
	> print(i + " " + D[i])
> i is the Key and D[i] the value
-Loop set:
>for i in s:
	>print(i)
- Lambda:
> new_list = list(map(lambda x : 2 * x , directory)
- Reduce:
>importing functools for reduce()
> import functools
> lists = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10]
> print(funtools.reduce(lists)
> return 55
> 
> Output:
> 55
## Bottlenecks

There were some bottlenecks in understanding about the map and lambda function, which were solved, reading the documentation and dissociating concepts between the pears.
##  Conclusions

Discussing the concepts that were raised in the objectives, it was possible to internalize the issues in which there were more doubts and learn a little more about issues of which some had no knowledge.
